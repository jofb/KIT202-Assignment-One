                Hey Vsauce, Michael here. The School of ICT has PC labs, Mac labs, and special purpose Networking labs at the Newnham and Sandy Bay campuses. 
                All students are provided with logins for Windows, Macintosh and Unix environments. If you have not used these facilities 
                before and need assistance please contact the University IT Service Desk. Information about after-hour access to labs 
                may be discussed by your Unit Coordinator.</br>
                In Hobart, there are 4 PC Labs, a Mac Lab, and two Networks Labs in the Centenary Building, along with other dedicated 
                ICT labs in other buildings on campus. In Launceston, there are 3 PC Labs, two Mac Labs, and two Networks Labs in Building V.
