    <h2>Introduction (example post)</h2>
    <h3>7 March 2077</h3>
    <p>This unit provides students with the knowledge, understanding, and skills required to develop an application 
        system which uses a web interface to a back-end database. The unit assumes a sound basic knowledge of programming 
        and database concepts and skills as developed in the introductory units in these areas. The emphasis in the unit 
        is on mastery of the key concepts and the basic knowledge and skills required to build this kind of application. 
        The unit will provide students with an awareness of the wide range of technologies which are used to support this 
        kind of application but will examine only a limited number of these technologies to demonstrate the key concepts and 
        their application. The unit explores the purposes and approaches in using scripting and mark-up languages in relation 
        to the client-server paradigm. The role of both server-side and client-side code are examined. Students will study the 
        use of mark-up and scripting programming languages to connect to databases via a network.</p>
