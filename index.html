            <p>This unit provides students with the knowledge, understanding, and skills required to develop an application 
                system which uses a web interface to a back-end database. The unit assumes a sound basic knowledge of programming 
                and database concepts and skills as developed in the introductory units in these areas. The emphasis in the unit 
                is on mastery of the key concepts and the basic knowledge and skills required to build this kind of application. 
                The unit will provide students with an awareness of the wide range of technologies which are used to support this 
                kind of application but will examine only a limited number of these technologies to demonstrate the key concepts and 
                their application. The unit explores the purposes and approaches in using scripting and mark-up languages in relation 
                to the client-server paradigm. The role of both server-side and client-side code are examined. Students will study the 
                use of mark-up and scripting programming languages to connect to databases via a network.

            <p>Hey Vsauce, Michael here. The School of ICT has PC labs, Mac labs, and special purpose Networking labs at the Newnham and Sandy Bay campuses. 
                All students are provided with logins for Windows, Macintosh and Unix environments. If you have not used these facilities 
                before and need assistance please contact the University IT Service Desk. Information about after-hour access to labs 
                may be discussed by your Unit Coordinator.</br>
                In Hobart, there are 4 PC Labs, a Mac Lab, and two Networks Labs in the Centenary Building, along with other dedicated 
                ICT labs in other buildings on campus. In Launceston, there are 3 PC Labs, two Mac Labs, and two Networks Labs in Building V.
